# Focusing on the experimental and computational study of fluid flow in pipes with flexible walls. 

-> Experiment was carried out on the deforming tube and verified by numberical FSI simulation
-> Due to the large deformations occurring during loading of the tube, it was necessary to work with a dynamic mesh in CFD part. 
-> Neo-Hookean and Mooney-Rivlin materil were considered 
-> Blood flowing in vessels is a heterogeneous liquid and exhibits non-Newtonian properties.
-> the result show mainly comparisons of unsteady velocity profiles between experimental and numberical model.


The Aim of the study was therefore primarily to compare the experimental part realized by (PIV) with numerical results of FSI simulation, which in addition to prediction allows a relatively large degree of evaluation and data collection for further study and analysis. 

# Experiment
-> the artery materil itself should be understood as anisotropic and heterogeneous.
-> it exhibits large elastic deformations and is classifed as a so-called hyperelastic materials, which are characterized by non-linear dependence between stress and strain. 

-> Water, chosen as the liquid, belongs to the Newtonian liquids
-> the deformation tube itself was made of silicon (polydimethylsiloxane - PDMS), which as subsequently considered hyperelastic and homogeneous.
-> the diaphragm pump as a source of pulsating flow
-> Data from Fig.2 was then used to define boundary conditions for numerical simulation 

# Numerical FSI simulation

-> System Coupling was used to bind FEM and CFD.
-> Transient Structural 
-> ANSYS Fluent


-> Due to the large deformation occuring during loading of the tube, it was necessary to work with a dynamic mesh in the CFD part of the task.
-> Dynamic mesh Update methods in Diffusion-based smoothing were chosen in the deforming regions. 
-> All zones of the fluid domain except for the liquid-elastic wall interface (wall deforming) were then defined as deforming.
