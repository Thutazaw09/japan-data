Comparison of CFD and FSI simulations of blood flow in stenotic
coronary arteries

-> Computational fluid dynamics methods, where only the blood flow
behavior is considered 
-> FSI model for the wall compliance

-> the infludence of wall compliance was noteworthy on wall shear stress distribution
its effect on wall shear stress and on the oscillatory shear index was minor.

# atheorosclerosis -> the blood clot on both arteris and veins

paper 1o to 13 are computational paper
paper 14 is the FSI paper 

# paper 21 and 22 are also FSI paper and paper 25


# Geometry 
the thickness of solid domain is 27 and 28
